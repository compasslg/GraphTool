# GraphTool
A tool made with unity to draw graph.

# Description
This tool is made because I was playing a mobile game involving a huge upgrade tree, and most of the nodes are just stat growth. I was tryna find the best way to spend my skill points, so this tool was made to mimic the process and calculate the overall stat gain. The tool is pretty simple and might be buggy, but at least it's usable.

# Future Plan
The current version already served its purposes, so I don't plan to put further effort in it unless I or someone else need to use it and demond extra features.
